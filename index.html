	<h1>The seven types of global city regions</h1>

	<div class="reading">
		<h3>The world's major metropolitan hubs concentrate the drivers of global prosperity, but they possess these resources in differing amounts and proportions. </h3>
		<p>The global economy was unable to regain its pre-crisis growth trend in 2016. Three months after the
		United Kingdom’s exit from a still-stagnant European Union and two months ahead of the presidential election in the United States, residents and leaders in advanced economies are responding to a decade of insufficiently inclusive economic growth. At the same time, the investment-led model that has propelled China’s economy forward, and the commodities-driven model that has done the same in Latin America, appears to be running up against diminishing returns.</p>

		<p>Amid these uncertainties, new questions naturally emerge about how and where the next round of durable economic growth will occur. In terms of “the how,” the developed world has long relied upon productivity-advancing ideas, knowledge, and global connectivity to spur rising living standards. Major emerging markets, as they have grown wealthier and can no longer rely on the forces of economic convergence alone to propel growth, are now increasingly reliant on a similar path to prosperity.</p>

		<p>“The where” within these nations will continue to be major cities and metropolitan areas, which concentrate the fundamental factors needed to create competitive environments and generate growth. The global economy and cities are inextricably linked. Cities are essential to the global economy—they are the locus for economic growth and development. And the global economy is essential to cities—tapping global demand for locally-produced goods and services is how they grow and prosper. Three megatrends are distinctly positioning cities as the world’s competitive economic units while simultaneously redefining what it takes for them to excel in today’s economy:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Urbanization, quite simply, has placed cities at the vanguard of global economic growth. Today’s markets crave the knowledge exchange, dense labor pools, and shared inputs that cities provide. 5 Thus, worldwide industrialization has coincided with worldwide urbanization.</li> 
		<li>Globalization, despite recent slowdowns in global goods trade, has intensified when measured at its broadest—flows of goods, services, capital, people, and data—and will continue apace. 7 Cities must maintain competitive traded clusters that generate exports and attract foreign investment, and connect locally made products and services to the global marketplace through physical and virtual infrastructure.</li>
		<li>Technological change will continue to disrupt industries and labor markets. Cities must endow their workforce with the skills needed to complement new technologies and the supportive environments for innovation.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The pervasiveness of these trends has integrated cities into a world system through which they both collaborate via trade and investment and compete to attract mobile firms, workers, and capital. In this way, all cities are “global cities.” Market integration has forced city leaders to examine their economic function within an international lens, understand their most potent tradable specializations, and then strengthen those traded industries by investing and stewarding local innovation, workforce, and infrastructure assets, all in service of growth that is robust, enduring, and broadly shared. 8 This aspiration is neither preordained nor easy. Achieving it requires a clear-eyed focus to define, build, and maintain a realistic global competitiveness strategy, acknowledging that all cities are must think globally but not necessarily in the same way.</p>
